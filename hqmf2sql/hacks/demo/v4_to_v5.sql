PURPOSE: Use this script to convert your OMOP V4 common data model to CDM V5.

last revised: 09 July 2015
author:  Patrick Ryan, Chris Knoll
editor: Anthony Sena

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This script was authored using TemplateSQL which will require you to run this
script through SqlRender to creat a version that is compatible with your target
RDBMS. We have pre-generated these scripts using SQL Render and have placed
them in folders for each RDBMS. Depending on which script you are viewing, your
instructions will be slightly different.

General Assumptions
-------------------

This script assumes that your V4 and V5 database are located on the same
RDBMS server.

Getting Started
---------------

Before you can use this script, there are some prerequisites:

 1. Create a target CDMv5 database on your server using the appropriate script
    from https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel
 2. Load VocabV5 into the target database/schema that will contain CDMv5 using
    Athena: http://ohdsi.org/web/ATHENA

TemplateSQL File Instructions
-----------------------------
 
 1. Set parameter name of schema that contains CDMv4 instance 
    ([SOURCE_CDMV4], [SOURCE_CDMV4].[SCHEMA])
 2. Set parameter name of schema that contains CDMv5 instance 
    ([TARGET_CDMV5], [TARGET_CDMV5].[SCHEMA])
 3. Run this script through SqlRender to produce a script that will work in your
    source dialect. SqlRender can be found here: https://github.com/OHDSI/SqlRender
 4. Run the script produced by SQL Render on your target RDBDMS.

<RDBMS> File Instructions
-------------------------

 1. This script will hold a number of placeholders for your CDM V4 and CDMV5
    database/schema. In order to make this file work in your environment, you 
	should plan to do a global "FIND AND REPLACE" on this file to fill in the 
	file with values that pertain to your environment. The following are the 
	tokens you should use when doing your "FIND AND REPLACE" operation:

	a. [SOURCE_CDMV4]
	b. [SOURCE_CDMV4].[SCHEMA]
    c. [TARGET_CDMV5]
	d. [TARGET_CDMV5].[SCHEMA]

 2. Run the resulting script on your target RDBDMS.

*********************************************************************************/

/* SCRIPT PARAMETERS */
					-- The CDMv4 database name
	-- The CDMv4 database plus schema
					-- The target CDMv5 database name
	-- the target CDMv5 database plus schema
 
SET search_path TO  :omop_v5_schema;

/*
 * The #concept_map table will hold the mapping of source_concept_ids to target_concept_ids
 * and their respective domain_ids. As a result, the results of this table will have 
 * some source_concept_ids that map to multiple target_concept_ids which is expected.
 *
 * In some of the conversion queries below, we will use the distinct values from the
 * #concept_map table since our need in those instances is to understand the domain_id
 * that will provide the destination table in the target V5 database. To make the code
 * easier to read, we dervied a #concept_map_distinct table that holds the distinct
 * source_concept_id and target domain_id.
 *
 * As of the dateof this script, the following domains contain source_concept_ids that 
 * map to multiple target_concept_ids:
 *
 * Condition
 * Device
 * Drug
 * Measurement
 * Observation
 * Procedure
 * Spec Anatomic Site
 *
 * Also, as of the date which this script was authored, no source_concept_ids map to multiple domains
