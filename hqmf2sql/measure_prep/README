Before running a measure (or set of measures), you'll need to create a schema for the results and create some
date-related helper functions. The procedure is:

In psql:
# create schema results;

Then, on the command line:

psql -f create_date_funcs.sql mydb

where mydb is your database. If you call the results schema something else, you'll need to edit create_date_funcs.sql.
